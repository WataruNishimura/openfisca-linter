    世帯 is an example of a group entity.
    A group entity contains one or more individual·s.
    Each individual in a group entity has a role (e.g. parent or children). Some roles can only be held by a limited number of individuals (e.g. a 'first_parent' can only be held by one individual), while others can have an unlimited number of individuals (e.g. 'children').

    Example:
    Housing variables (e.g. 固定資産税') are usually defined for a group entity such as '世帯'.

    Usage:
    Check the number of individuals of a specific role (e.g. check if there is a 'second_parent' with 世帯.nb_人物(世帯.SECOND_PARENT)).
    Calculate a variable applied to each individual of the group entity (e.g. calculate the '所得' of each member of the '世帯' with salaries = 世帯.members("所得", period = MONTH); sum_salaries = 世帯.sum(salaries)).
